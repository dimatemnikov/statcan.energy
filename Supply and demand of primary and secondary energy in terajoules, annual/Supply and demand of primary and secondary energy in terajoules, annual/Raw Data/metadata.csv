1,"For quarterly data on reference years prior to 2002, please see CANSIM table 128-0002."
2,"CANSIM tables 128-0009, 128-0010 and 128-0015 have been archived and replaced with CANSIM tables 128-0016, 128-0017 and 128-0018. Comparisons of the new datasets with earlier published datasets should be done with caution."
3,"Values for production and availability for ""total primary and secondary"" are not shown as these would lead to double-counting of fuels that are both a primary energy form and used to produce a secondary energy form."
4,"Shows the net inter-regional movement of product between regions."
5,"Shows the transfer of similar products between different product forms; for example, still gas to natural gas, natural gas to produce hydrogen in petroleum refineries."
6,"Includes cyclical billing variations, metering differences and losses in transportation. In the case of crude oil, includes sales to non-refineries."
7,"The amount which was available for use. This includes the summation of production, imports, inter-regional transfers, inter-product transfers and other adjustments, less exports and stock variation."
8,"The amount available after the amounts used in transformation processes are subtracted. Availability minus stock change, utilities and industry, transformed to electricity - by utilities, transformed to electricity - by industry, transformed to coke and manufactured gases, transformed to refined products and transformed to steam generation."
9,"Producers' consumption as measured here is the consumption by the producing industry of its own produced fuel; for example, refined petroleum products consumed by the refined petroleum product industry, or natural gas used in the field, flared and waste, field uses, gathering uses, plant uses and metering adjustments. It does not include consumption of energy forms produced by other energy supply industries; for example, it would exclude the use of natural gas by the petroleum refining industry. In the case of electricity, it includes transmission losses, adjustments, unaccounted for amounts which are subject to variation because of cyclical billing, etcetera, but excludes generating station use output as measured at the generating station gate."
10,"Amounts shown here are for amounts used for purposes other than fuel purposes. Includes products being used as petrochemical feedstock, anodes and/or cathodes, greases, lubricants, etcetera."
